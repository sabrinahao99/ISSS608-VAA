    "text": "4.1 Variable Selection\nFirst, I select some useful variables required for EDA process and ensure the raw column names are consistently referenced. To ensure that the variables for subsequent visualization are cleaned, we should eliminate noise(drop useless variables). For the selection of direct variables, I chose to retain only those directly related to demographics, learning habits, and personal perceptions. In this step, I specifically excluded the following variables for the following reasons:\n\nGender(A.2): To focus the analysis on universally applicable learning strategies and perceptual dimensions, gender was considered noise and therefore excluded.\nSocioeconomic indicators (A.3, A.4, A.5): I excluded “policy support,” “minority status,” and “poverty status.” This analysis emphasizes individual student behaviors more than macro-level “socioeconomic background factors.”\nParental Occupation indicators (A.8, A.9): I selected “parents’ education level” and excluded “parents’ occupation.” In educational research, education level is generally considered a more stable and explanatory indicator of family cultural capital.\n\nSince most variables in the original dataset were numerical, I recoded them into meaningful and easily interpretable category labels according to the official coding manual. This step involved converting the raw data into ordinal factors (e.g., converting “1, 2, 3” into “none, moderate, very”), thus ensuring that subsequent visualizations and statistical tests were ordinal and valid.\n\n\nCode\nfinal_ggplot &lt;- raw_dataset\n\nfinal_ggplot$Year_Label &lt;- factor(final_ggplot$Year, levels = 1:5, \n    labels = c(\"First-year\", \"Second-year\", \"Third-year\", \"Fourth-year\", \"Graduated\"))\n\nfinal_ggplot$Father_Edu_Label &lt;- factor(final_ggplot$Father_Edu, levels = 1:6, \n    labels = c(\"Primary\", \"Secondary\", \"High School\", \"College\", \"University/Grad\", \"Other\"))\n\nfinal_ggplot$Mother_Edu_Label &lt;- factor(final_ggplot$Mother_Edu, levels = 1:6, \n    labels = c(\"Primary\", \"Secondary\", \"High School\", \"College\", \"University/Grad\", \"Other\"))\n\nfinal_ggplot$Friends_Label &lt;- ordered(final_ggplot$Time_Friends, levels = 1:5, \n    labels = c(\"&lt;1h\", \"1-2h\", \"2-3h\", \"3-4h\", \"&gt;=4h\"))\n\nfinal_ggplot$Social_Media_Label &lt;- ordered(final_ggplot$Time_SocicalMedia, levels = 1:5, \n    labels = c(\"&lt;1h\", \"1-2h\", \"2-3h\", \"3-4h\", \"&gt;=4h\"))\n\nfinal_ggplot$Study_Time_Label &lt;- ordered(final_ggplot$Time_Studying, levels = 1:5, \n    labels = c(\"&lt;2h\", \"2-4h\", \"4-6h\", \"6-8h\", \"&gt;=8h\"))\n\nfinal_ggplot$GPA_Label &lt;- ordered(final_ggplot$GPA, levels = 1:5, \n    labels = c(\"&lt;2.0 (Poor)\", \"2.0–2.5 (Avg)\", \"2.5–3.2 (Fair)\", \"3.2–3.6 (Good)\", \"&gt;=3.6 (Excl)\"))\n\ngpa_map &lt;- c(1.50, 2.25, 2.85, 3.40, 3.85)\nfinal_ggplot$GPA_Num &lt;- gpa_map[as.numeric(as.character(final_ggplot$GPA))]\n\nfinal_ggplot$Adapt_Learning_Uni &lt;- ordered(final_ggplot$Adapt_Learning_Uni, levels = 1:5, \n                                           labels = c(\"Not at all\", \"Little\", \"Moderate\", \"Quite\", \"Very\"))\n\nfinal_ggplot$Study_Methods      &lt;- ordered(final_ggplot$Study_Methods, levels = 1:5, \n                                           labels = c(\"Not at all\", \"Little\", \"Moderate\", \"Quite\", \"Very\"))\n\nfinal_ggplot$SupportOf_Uni      &lt;- ordered(final_ggplot$SupportOf_Uni, levels = 1:5, \n                                           labels = c(\"Not at all\", \"Little\", \"Moderate\", \"Quite\", \"Very\"))\n\nfinal_ggplot$SupportOf_Lec      &lt;- ordered(final_ggplot$SupportOf_Lec, levels = 1:5, \n                                           labels = c(\"Not at all\", \"Little\", \"Moderate\", \"Quite\", \"Very\"))\n\nfinal_ggplot$Facilitie_Uni      &lt;- ordered(final_ggplot$Facilitie_Uni, levels = 1:5, \n                                           labels = c(\"Not at all\", \"Little\", \"Moderate\", \"Quite\", \"Very\"))\n\nfinal_ggplot$Quality_Lecturer   &lt;- ordered(final_ggplot$Quality_Lecturer, levels = 1:5, \n                                           labels = c(\"Not at all\", \"Little\", \"Moderate\", \"Quite\", \"Very\"))\n\nfinal_ggplot$TrainingCurriculum &lt;- ordered(final_ggplot$TrainingCurriculum, levels = 1:5, \n                                           labels = c(\"Not at all\", \"Little\", \"Moderate\", \"Quite\", \"Very\"))\n\nfinal_ggplot$Competitive_Class  &lt;- ordered(final_ggplot$Competitive_Class, levels = 1:5, \n                                           labels = c(\"Not at all\", \"Little\", \"Moderate\", \"Quite\", \"Very\"))\n\nfinal_ggplot$InfuenceF_Friends  &lt;- ordered(final_ggplot$InfuenceF_Friends, levels = 1:5, \n                                           labels = c(\"Not at all\", \"Little\", \"Moderate\", \"Quite\", \"Very\"))\n#mapping GPA into numerical form GPA_Num\nfinal_ggplot$Study_Methods_Raw &lt;- raw_dataset$Study_Methods\nfinal_ggplot$GPA_Raw &lt;- raw_dataset$GPA\ngpa_map &lt;- c(1.50, 2.25, 2.85, 3.40, 3.85)\nfinal_ggplot$GPA_Num &lt;- gpa_map[as.numeric(as.character(final_ggplot$GPA_Raw))]\nfinal_ggplot$Study_Methods_Fix &lt;- factor(final_ggplot$Study_Methods_Raw, \n                                         levels = 1:5, \n                                         labels = c(\"Not at all\", \"Little\", \"Moderate\", \"Quite\", \"Very\"))\n\n\nNote:Under is &lt;, Over is &gt;=, use symbols simplifies the final presentation."

    "text": "Viz1: Academic performance exhibits high median stability but increasing divergence in later study years\nTo explore the evolution of GPA distribution across different grade levels, I first cleaned the raw data. I mapped the categorical variable GPA to numerical midpoints (e.g., mapping grade 1 to 1.50 and grade 5 to 3.85), making GPA an analyzable numerical score for easy visualization. Next, I used the ggridges package to create a ridge plot to show the probability density distribution of grades across grade levels. Then, I used stat_density_ridges to automatically calculate quantiles. The extreme 2.5% regions at both ends of the distribution are highlighted in red and blue in the plot. This approach not only visually presents the central tendency of grades across grade levels but also effectively identifies the proportion of students with abnormally high or low GPAs.\n\n\nCode\n#stats(quantile)\nggplot(final_ggplot, \n       aes(x = GPA_Num, \n           y = Year_Label, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile)))) + \n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = c(0.025, 0.975)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Probability\",\n    values = c(\"#FF0000A0\", \"#A0A0A0A0\", \"#0000FFA0\"),\n    labels = c(\"(0, 0.025]\", \"(0.025, 0.975]\", \"(0.975, 1]\")\n  ) +\n  \n  theme_ridges() +\n labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Student GPA Scores by Academic Year\",\n    subtitle = \"Academic performance exhibits high median stability but increasing divergence in later study years\",\n    x = \"GPA Score (Mapping GPA category)\",\n    y = \"Academic Year\"\n  )+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, color = \"gray30\", margin = margin(b = 10)),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 11, face = \"plain\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11, face = \"plain\"),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote😺 Observations\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the GPA of students across all grades is around 3.0 (between Fair and Good), showing a significant peak. This indicates that the school’s students have very stable academic performance, with no extremely low scores, and the overall teaching quality is good.\nAs students progress through the years, they should be more adapted to university life, but the red zone on the left remains stable across all grades, especially in the third year. The reason for such a high proportion may need to be explored in terms of student perception or other aspects, such as their level of adaptation.\nTowards graduation, the density of the blue zone on the right increases slightly, and the curve slopes more pronounced to the right. This may be because students nearing graduation have found a better study method, thus learning better and faster, resulting in a higher probability of having a high GPA."

A student’s GPA was recorded as TRUE if it was in the range of “3.2-3.6 (Good)” or “≥3.6 (Excellent),” and as FALSE otherwise. This binary variable fairly compares the relationship between parental education level and GPA. Next, I summarized the data by Father_Edu_Label and Mother_Edu_Label, calculating the sample size and high GPA rate for each group. Then, to determine the baseline for the funnel plot, I calculated a weighted average of these rates with a weight of \\(1/se^2\\) to ensure that groups with larger sample sizes and more stable estimates have a greater impact on the overall mean. Next, I generated 95% (dashed line) and 99.9% (solid line) confidence intervals to define the expected range of variation.

    "text": "Viz3: Mother’s education shows a more consistent impact on student GPA\nFirst, we need to process the fields – defining High GPA. This requires converting the original GPA_Cat into a binary variable, where high rate means: when a student’s GPA falls within “3.2–&lt;3.6 (Good)” or “≥3.6 (Excellent),” it is recorded as TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE. This can be used to compare the high GPA performance of different groups. Next, we group by parent’s education level and calculate the High GPA rate. First, we group separately for Father_Edu / Mother_Edu, calculating n (sample size) and rate. Then, we calculate the overall mean, using weights of 1 / rate.se^2 to give higher weights to groups with larger sample sizes and more stable estimates. Then, we generate the 95% / 99% confidence limits for the funnel. Finally, we use the above output to generate the plot.

Furthermore, the high density near the median suggests that mothers’ education levels may play a more significant role in students’ GPAs than fathers’."

    "text": "Viz4: High GPA students spent more time on study while spent less on social media\nHere, I use a ternary plot to show the proportions of students spending time on three categories of daily activities (studying/social media/going out with friends). I also color-code points according to different GPA categories to reflect the distribution differences among different GPA categories. The implementation process is as follows: First, I convert the grouping intervals of the three time variables into midpoints for easier comparison, based on the official codebook. For example, social media and going out with friends are 0.5/1.5/2.5/3.5/4.5, while study time—less than 2 hours of study time—is 1, and so on, 3/5/7/9. Then, I obtain three new variables, sm_new, fri_new, and st_new, from the defined midpoints. By calculating the total time (total), and dividing the three new variables by total, I obtain their respective proportions, sm_p, fri_p, and st_p. Finally, I convert GPA_Cat into a factor, use ggtern() to draw the plot, and color-code it according to GPA category to observe the clustering trend of different GPA groups in the three types of time allocation.\n\n\nCode\nmidp_sm_fri &lt;- c(0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5) \nmidp_study  &lt;- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)\ntime_tri_mutated &lt;- final_ggplot %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # turn categorical variable into midpoint value\n    sm_val = midp_sm_fri[as.integer(Time_SocicalMedia)],\n    fri_val = midp_sm_fri[as.integer(Time_Friends)],\n    st_val  = midp_study[as.integer(Time_Studying)],\n    TOTAL = sm_val + fri_val + st_val\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(TOTAL &gt; 0) \n#plot \nggtern(data = time_tri_mutated, aes(x = st_val, y = sm_val, z = fri_val, colour = GPA_Label)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"High GPA students spent more time on study while spent less on social media\",\n    subtitle = \"Ternary plot shows the trade-off between Study, Social Media, and Friends\",\n    colour = \"GPA Category\"\n  ) +\n    theme_rgbw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote😺 Observations\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen from the distribution of the data points, most points are clearly clustered near the Social Media area, while there is almost no clustering near the Study and Outings locations. This indicates that most students in the sample spend their time on social media, with relatively less time allocated to studying and outings.\nAt the GPA category level, the distribution of points within each subcategory has a high degree of overlap, and the hypothetical scenario of “high GPA being significantly closer to the learning peak” does not occur. Here we can conclude that judging by the proportion of time spent near the midpoint of the interval, the differences in GPA between groups may be weak. Further statistical tests are needed to confirm this (testing each of the three variables against the GPA Category will yield a more rigorous conclusion).\n\n\n\n\n\nViz5: Does high GPA students spent less time on social media and more on study?\nFirst, I use ggbetweenstats() to test and display the differences between the three time variables and GPA groups. Since the upper limits of the scales for the three time variables are inconsistent (the highest for study time is “≥8 hours”, while the highest for others is “&gt;4 hours”), to ensure comparability, I converted each category to an interval midpoint according to the official codebook, thus unifying the unit of measurement to “hours”. After mapping the midpoints, I then generated three numerical variables—Study_hours, Media_hours, and Friends_hours—based on the selected fields, and performed tests with GPA_Cat as the grouping variable (x) and time as y.\nFor statistical testing, considering that the distribution of the time variables may be non-normal and that the sample sizes between groups are unbalanced, I still used the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test to attempt to test the differences in time allocation among different GPA groups.\n\n\nCode\n# use mutate\ndf_time_analysis &lt;- final_ggplot %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    st_hours  = midp_study[as.integer(Time_Studying)],\n    sm_hours  = midp_sm_fri[as.integer(Time_SocicalMedia)],\n    fri_hours = midp_sm_fri[as.integer(Time_Friends)],\n    TOTAL     = st_hours + sm_hours + fri_hours\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(TOTAL &gt; 0)\n# use ggbetweenstats \nviz_study &lt;- ggbetweenstats(\n  data = df_time_analysis,\n  x = GPA_Label,\n  y = st_hours,\n  type = \"np\", #non-parametric\n  messages = FALSE\n) + labs(\n  title = \"Study hours across GPA categories\",\n  x = \"GPA Category\", \n  y = \"Study Time (hours)\"\n)\n\nviz_media &lt;- ggbetweenstats(\n  data = df_time_analysis,\n  x = GPA_Label,\n  y = sm_hours,\n  type = \"np\",\n  messages = FALSE\n) + labs(\n  title = \"Social media time across GPA categories\",\n  x = \"GPA Category\", \n  y = \"Social Media Time (hours)\"\n)\n\nviz_friends &lt;- ggbetweenstats(\n  data = df_time_analysis,\n  x = GPA_Label,\n  y = fri_hours,\n  type = \"np\",\n  messages = FALSE\n) + labs(\n  title = \"Time spent with friends across GPA categories\",\n  x = \"GPA Category\", \n  y = \"Friends Time (hours)\"\n)\n#patchwork\n(viz_study) / (viz_media | viz_friends)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote😺 Observations\n\n\n\nTo compare students’ time-use distributions across GPA groups, we applied the Kruskal–Wallis (non-parametric) test. All three time variables were statistically significant across GPA categories.\n• Study time: Median study time was 9 hours for every GPA group, mainly because many students fall into the ≥8 hours band. The clearest difference is that the lower-GPA group has a higher share of students with shorter study time.\n• Social media time: The lower-GPA group shows a higher median social media time, suggesting they spend more time on social media.\n• Friends time: Median differences are small; significance indicates only a weak relationship with GPA. Overall, effect sizes are small, meaning differences are modest and driven more by distributional shifts than large between-group gaps."

After completing the previous section, I couldn’t help but wonder: besides behavior, are there also systemic differences between perceptual experience and GPA? Which perceptual dimensions are most relevant?\n\nViz6: Students are most satisfied with school but personal habits still decides at certain cases\nThis figure uses HH to plot, illustrating the frequency distribution of students’ responses to eight learning perception items on a 1–5 Likert scale. First, the eight variables (table b) were extracted from final_ggplot, and then convert the wide table to a long table, resulting in two columns: Measure and Response. I then created a contingency table for these two columns, converting each row to a percentage. This was done to eliminate the impact of sample size differences on the graph’s scale. Finally, I used the HH::likert() function to plot the Diverging Stacked Bar, using percentages as a uniform measure to directly show the differences and frequency distribution of each variable.\n\n\nCode\nsurvey_vars &lt;- c(\"Study_Methods\", \"SupportOf_Uni\", \"SupportOf_Lec\", \"Facilitie_Uni\", \n                 \"Quality_Lecturer\", \"TrainingCurriculum\", \"Competitive_Class\", \"InfuenceF_Friends\")\n#prepare long table\nsurvey_long &lt;- final_ggplot[, survey_vars] %&gt;%\n  gather(measure, response)\n#Converting to factor\nsurvey_long$measure &lt;- as.factor(survey_long$measure)\nsurvey_long$response &lt;- as.factor(survey_long$response)\n# Creating the contingency table\nsurvey_df &lt;- table(survey_long$measure, survey_long$response) %&gt;%\n  as.data.frame.matrix()\n# Changing the column name\ncolnames(survey_df) &lt;- c(\"Not at all\", \"Little\", \"Moderate\", \"Quite\", \"Very\")\n\nrownames(survey_df) &lt;- c(\"Class Competition\", \"University Facilities\", \"Peer Influence\", \n                         \"Lecturer Support\", \"Lecturer Quality\", \"Study Methods\", \n                         \"University Support\", \"Training Curriculum\")\n# Changing the dataframe row name\nsurvey_df &lt;- tibble::rownames_to_column(survey_df, var = \"Measure\")\n# plot using HH package\nlikert(Measure ~ ., \n       data = survey_df, \n       ylab = NULL,\n       ReferenceZero = 3, \n       as.percent = TRUE,\n       positive.order = TRUE, \n       main = list(\" Most of Students are generally satisfied with Learning Perceptions\", x = unit(.55, \"npc\")), \n       sub = list(\"Satisfaction Rating (1-5 Scale)\", x = unit(.57, \"npc\")),\n       xlim = c(-100, -80, -60, -40, -20, 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100),\n       strip = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-   ::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n    ## 😺 Observations\n\n    -   Overall, the eight variables related to learning perceptions are significantly biased towards the positive: \"very\" generally accounts for a larger proportion than \"not at all,\" indicating respondents have a positive evaluation of the school's environment and support. The proportion of \"very\" is large for teaching-related dimensions, indicating respondents are satisfied with these variables. Conversely, proportions of \"Moderate\" and \"little\" are relatively high for \"Study_Methods\" and \"influence from friends,\" indicating these factors are more likely related to personal habits.\n\n    -   This leads to a conclusion that respondents are generally satisfied with learning perceptions, but some factors still depend on individual differences. Besides, it also provides an overview for subsequent analysis of the relationship between perception variables and GPA.\n    :::\n:::\n\n\nViz7: Does GPA have the relationship with perception variables?\nFirst, I selected all perceptual variables and GPA (num). Since Likert categorizes variables by class, I converted all variables into ordered numerical representations by as.numeric function. Then, I used cor(method=“spearman”) to generate the Spearman correlation matrix. Finally, I used the basic function heatmap() to visualize the correlation matrix, preserving the hierarchical clustering dendrogram to observe the similarity and clustering structure between variables.\n\n\nCode\n# selecting vars\nvar_list &lt;- c(\"GPA_Num\", \"Adapt_Learning_Uni\", \"Study_Methods\", \"SupportOf_Uni\", \n              \"SupportOf_Lec\", \"Facilitie_Uni\", \"Quality_Lecturer\", \n              \"TrainingCurriculum\", \"Competitive_Class\", \"InfuenceF_Friends\")\ncorrel_var &lt;- final_ggplot[, var_list]\n# turn into numerical as.numeric\ncorrel_var$GPA_Num           &lt;- as.numeric(as.factor(correl_var$GPA_Num))\ncorrel_var$Adapt_Learning_Uni &lt;- as.numeric(as.factor(correl_var$Adapt_Learning_Uni))\ncorrel_var$Study_Methods     &lt;- as.numeric(as.factor(correl_var$Study_Methods))\ncorrel_var$SupportOf_Uni     &lt;- as.numeric(as.factor(correl_var$SupportOf_Uni))\ncorrel_var$SupportOf_Lec     &lt;- as.numeric(as.factor(correl_var$SupportOf_Lec))\ncorrel_var$Facilitie_Uni     &lt;- as.numeric(as.factor(correl_var$Facilitie_Uni))\ncorrel_var$Quality_Lecturer  &lt;- as.numeric(as.factor(correl_var$Quality_Lecturer))\ncorrel_var$TrainingCurriculum &lt;- as.numeric(as.factor(correl_var$TrainingCurriculum))\ncorrel_var$Competitive_Class &lt;- as.numeric(as.factor(correl_var$Competitive_Class))\ncorrel_var$InfuenceF_Friends &lt;- as.numeric(as.factor(correl_var$InfuenceF_Friends))\n\n# spearman matrix\nwh_matrix &lt;- cor(correl_var, method = \"spearman\")\nwh_matrix[is.na(wh_matrix)] &lt;- 0\n\n# plot heatmap\nheatmap(\n  wh_matrix,\n  Rowv = NA, Colv = NA,         \n  scale = \"none\", \n  cexRow = 0.9, cexCol = 0.9,\n  margins = c(12, 10),\n  main = \"Does GPA have the relationship with perception variables?\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote😺 Observations\n\n\n\n\nWe can easily observe significant positive correlations among the nine learning perception variables (darker areas), indicating that these perception dimensions are interdependent and related.

The overall trend is that the perception variables have a strong synergistic effect, while GPA has virtually no relationship with any single perception variable."

In this section, you will learn how to create a scatterplot matrix by using the pairs function of R Graphics.\nBefore you continue to the next step, you should read the syntax description of pairsfunction.\n\n6.4.1 Building a basic correlation matrix\nFigure below shows the scatter plot matrix of Wine Quality Data. It is a 11 by 11 matrix.\n\npairs(wine[,1:11])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations: The required input of pairs() can be a matrix or data frame. The code chunk used to create the scatterplot matrix is relatively simple. It uses the default pairs function. Columns 2 to 12 of wine dataframe is used to build the scatterplot matrix. The variables are: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4.2 Drawing the lower corner\npairs function of R Graphics provided many customisation arguments. For example, it is a common practice to show either the upper half or lower half of the correlation matrix instead of both. This is because a correlation matrix is symmetric.\nTo show the lower half of the correlation matrix, the upper.panel argument will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], upper.panel = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, you can display the upper half of the correlation matrix by using the code chun below.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], lower.panel = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations: upper.panel function is used for showing half of the correlation matrix.\n\n\n6.4.3 Including with correlation coefficients\nTo show the correlation coefficient of each pair of variables instead of a scatter plot, panel.cor function will be used. This will also show higher correlations in a larger font.\nDon’t worry about the details for now-just type this code into your R session or script. Let’s have more fun way to display the correlation matrix.\n\npanel.cor &lt;- function(x, y, digits=2, prefix=\"\", cex.cor, ...) {\nusr &lt;- par(\"usr\")\non.exit(par(usr))\npar(usr = c(0, 1, 0, 1))\nr &lt;- abs(cor(x, y, use=\"complete.obs\"))\ntxt &lt;- format(c(r, 0.123456789), digits=digits)[1]\ntxt &lt;- paste(prefix, txt, sep=\"\")\nif(missing(cex.cor)) cex.cor &lt;- 0.8/strwidth(txt)\ntext(0.5, 0.5, txt, cex = cex.cor * (1 + r) / 2)\n}\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], \n      upper.panel = panel.cor)"

    "text": "6.7 Visualising Correlation Matrix using corrplot Package\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will focus on corrplot. However, you are encouraged to explore the other two packages too.\nBefore getting started, you are required to read [An Introduction to corrplot Package]https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html in order to gain basic understanding of corrplot package.\n\n6.7.1 Getting started with corrplot\nBefore we can plot a corrgram using corrplot(), we need to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame. In the code chunk below, cor() of R Stats is used to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\n\nwine.cor &lt;- cor(wine[, 1:11])\n\nNext, corrplot() is used to plot the corrgram by using all the default setting as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the default visual object used to plot the corrgram is circle. The default layout of the corrgram is a symmetric matrix. The default colour scheme is diverging blue-red. Blue colours are used to represent pair variables with positive correlation coefficients and red colours are used to represent pair variables with negative correlation coefficients. The intensity of the colour or also know as saturation is used to represent the strength of the correlation coefficient. Darker colours indicate relatively stronger linear relationship between the paired variables. On the other hand, lighter colours indicates relatively weaker linear relationship.\n\n\n6.7.2 Working with visual geometrics\nIn corrplot package, there are seven visual geometrics (parameter method) can be used to encode the attribute values. They are: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie. The default is circle. As shown in the previous section, the default visual geometric of corrplot matrix is circle. However, this default setting can be changed by using the method argument as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to change the method argument to other supported visual geometrics, In corrplot, besides “ellipse”, these are some commonly used methods (all officially supported): “circle”: The size/color of the circle represents the correlation strength. “square”: The size/color of the square represents the correlation strength. “number”: Directly displays the correlation coefficient number. “shade”: Uses shades of shadow to represent strength.\n“color”: Solid color block (heatmap style).\n“pie”: Small pie chart sector representing strength.\n“blank”: Blank (often used to display only the upper/lower triangle, leaving the other half empty).\n\n\n6.7.3 Working with layout\ncorrplor() supports three layout types, namely: “full”, “upper” or “lower”. The default is “full” which display full matrix. The default setting can be changed by using the type argument of corrplot().\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default layout of the corrgram can be further customised. For example, arguments diag and tl.col are used to turn off the diagonal cells and to change the axis text label colour to black colour respectively as shown in the code chunk and figure below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to experiment with other layout design argument such as tl.pos, tl.cex, tl.offset, cl.pos, cl.cex and cl.offset, just to mention a few of them.\n\n\n6.7.4 Working with mixed layout\nWith corrplot package, it is possible to design corrgram with mixed visual matrix of one half and numerical matrix on the other half. In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.\nFigure below shows a mixed layout corrgram plotted using wine quality data.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk used to plot the corrgram are shown below.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations:Notice that argument lower and upper are used to define the visualisation method used. In this case ellipse is used to map the lower half of the corrgram and numerical matrix (i.e. number) is used to map the upper half of the corrgram. The argument tl.pos, on the other, is used to specify the placement of the axis label. Lastly, the diag argument is used to specify the glyph on the principal diagonal of the corrgram.\n\n\n6.7.5 Combining corrgram with the significant test\nIn statistical analysis, we are also interested to know which pair of variables their correlation coefficients are statistically significant.\nFigure below shows a corrgram combined with the significant test. The corrgram reveals that not all correlation pairs are statistically significant. For example the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free surfur dioxide is statistically significant at significant level of 0.1 but not the pair between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid. With corrplot package, we can use the cor.mtest() to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\nWe can then use the p.mat argument of corrplot function as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.6 Reorder a corrgram\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details. “FPC” for the first principal component order. “hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used. “hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”. “alphabet” for alphabetical order. “AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. More algorithms can be found in seriation package.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.7 Reordering a correlation matrix using hclust\nIf using hclust, corrplot() can draw rectangles around the corrgram based on the results of hierarchical clustering.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)"

Moreover, the corresponding dendrogram are provided beside the heatmap.\n\nHere, red cells denotes small values, and red small ones. This heatmap is not really informative. Indeed, the Happiness Score variable have relatively higher values, what makes that the other variables with small values all look the same. Thus, we need to normalize this matrix. This is done using the scale argument. It can be applied to rows or to columns following your needs.\nThe code chunk below normalises the matrix column-wise.\n\nwh_heatmap &lt;- heatmap(wh_matrix,\n                      scale=\"column\",\n                      cexRow = 0.6, \n                      cexCol = 0.8,\n                      margins = c(10, 4))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the values are scaled now.

We will still use the wh_matrix as the input data.\n\n14.5.1 Working with heatmaply\n\nheatmaply(mtcars)\n\nWarning in doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler): unable to load shared object '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/modules//R_X11.so':\n  dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/modules//R_X11.so, 0x0006): Library not loaded: /opt/X11/lib/libSM.6.dylib\n  Referenced from: &lt;7ECC4104-EC6A-38FD-9BEA-BFE0B870925C&gt; /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.5-arm64/Resources/modules/R_X11.so\n  Reason: tried: '/opt/X11/lib/libSM.6.dylib' (no such file), '/System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes/OS/opt/X11/lib/libSM.6.dylib' (no such file), '/opt/X11/lib/libSM.6.dylib' (no such file), '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib/libSM.6.dylib' (no such file), '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.18+10/Contents/Home/lib/server/libSM.6.dylib' (no such file)\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\nℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the dendextend package.\n  Please report the issue at &lt;https://github.com/talgalili/dendextend/issues&gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows the basic syntax needed to create n interactive heatmap by using heatmaply package.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)])\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\nDifferent from heatmap(), for heatmaply() the default horizontal dendrogram is placed on the left hand side of the heatmap.\nThe text label of each raw, on the other hand, is placed on the right hand side of the heat map.\nWhen the x-axis marker labels are too long, they will be rotated by 135 degree from the north.\n\n\n\n14.5.2 Data trasformation\nWhen analysing multivariate data set, it is very common that the variables in the data sets includes values that reflect different types of measurement. In general, these variables’ values have their own range. In order to ensure that all the variables have comparable values, data transformation are commonly used before clustering.\nThree main data transformation methods are supported by heatmaply(), namely: scale, normalise and percentilse.\n\n14.5.2.1 Scaling method\n\nWhen all variables are came from or assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution.\nIn such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to scale variable values columewise.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.2.2 Normalising method\n\nWhen variables in the data comes from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations.\nThis preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”.\n\nDifferent from Scaling, the normalise method is performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.2.3 Percentising method\n\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank.\nThis is done by using the ecdf of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile.\nThe benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, it is the percent of observations that got that value or below it.\n\nSimilar to Normalize method, the Percentize method is also performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.3 Clustering algorithm\nheatmaply supports a variety of hierarchical clustering algorithm. The main arguments provided are:\n\ndistfun: function used to compute the distance (dissimilarity) between both rows and columns. Defaults to dist. The options “pearson”, “spearman” and “kendall” can be used to use correlation-based clustering, which uses as.dist(1 - cor(t(x))) as the distance metric (using the specified correlation method).\nhclustfun: function used to compute the hierarchical clustering when Rowv or Colv are not dendrograms. Defaults to hclust.\ndist_method default is NULL, which results in “euclidean” to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to distfun. By default distfun is “dist”” hence this can be one of “euclidean”, “maximum”, “manhattan”, “canberra”, “binary” or “minkowski”.\nhclust_method default is NULL, which results in “complete” method to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to hclustfun. By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average” (= UPGMA), “mcquitty” (= WPGMA), “median” (= WPGMC) or “centroid” (= UPGMC).\n\nIn general, a clustering model can be calibrated either manually or statistically.\n\n\n14.5.4 Manual approach\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmap is plotted by using hierachical clustering algorithm with “Euclidean distance” and “ward.D” method.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.5 Statistical approach\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, the dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\n\nwh_d &lt;- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output table shows that “average” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.\n\nwh_clust &lt;- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k &lt;- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure above shows that k=3 would be good.\nWith reference to the statistical analysis results, we can prepare the code chunk as shown below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.6 Seriation\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default options is “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) which optimizes the above criterion (in O(n^4)). Another option is “GW” (Gruvaeus and Wainer) which aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'gclus':\n  method         from     \n  reorder.hclust seriation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “mean” gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.7 Working with colour palettes\nThe default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. heatmaply users, however, can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\nIn the code chunk below, the Blues colour palette of rColorBrewer is used\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.8 The finishing touch\nBeside providing a wide collection of arguments for meeting the statistical analysis needs, heatmaply also provides many plotting features to ensure cartographic quality heatmap can be produced.\nIn the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 2.5,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

    "text": "15.1 Overview\nParallel coordinates plot is a data visualisation specially designed for visualising and analysing multivariate, numerical data. It is ideal for comparing multiple variables together and seeing the relationships between them. For example, the variables contribute to Happiness Index. Parallel coordinates was invented by Alfred Inselberg in the 1970s as a way to visualize high-dimensional data. This data visualisation technique is more often found in academic and scientific communities than in business and consumer data visualizations. As pointed out by Stephen Few(2006), “This certainly isn’t a chart that you would present to the board of directors or place on your Web site for the general public. In fact, the strength of parallel coordinates isn’t in their ability to communicate some truth in the data to others, but rather in their ability to bring meaningful multivariate patterns and comparisons to light when used interactively for analysis.” For example, parallel coordinates plot can be used to characterise clusters detected during customer segmentation.\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on:\n\nplotting statistic parallel coordinates plots by using ggparcoord() of GGally package, and\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parallelPlot package."

    "text": "15.4 Plotting Static Parallel Coordinates Plot\nIn this section, you will learn how to plot static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord() of GGally package. Before getting started, it is a good practice to read the function description in detail.\n\n15.4.1 Plotting a simple parallel coordinates\nCode chunk below shows a typical syntax used to plot a basic static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12))+\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, vjust = 1, size = 7),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)),\n    plot.margin  = margin(t = 10, r = 10, b = 50, l = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that only two argument namely data and columns is used. Data argument is used to map the data object (i.e. wh) and columns is used to select the columns for preparing the parallel coordinates plot.\n\n\n15.4.2 Plotting a parallel coordinates with boxplot\nThe basic parallel coordinates failed to reveal any meaning understanding of the World Happiness measures. In this section, you will learn how to makeover the plot by using a collection of arguments provided by ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Parallel Coordinates Plot of World Happines Variables\")+\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, vjust = 1, size = 7),\n    axis.title.x = element_blank(),              \n    plot.title = element_text(margin = margin(b = 10)),\n    plot.margin = margin(t = 10, r = 10, b = 70, l = 10)  \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above.\n\ngroupColumn argument is used to group the observations (i.e. parallel lines) by using a single variable (i.e. Region) and colour the parallel coordinates lines by region name.\nscale argument is used to scale the variables in the parallel coordinate plot by using uniminmax method. The method univariately scale each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.\nalphaLines argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1.\nboxplot argument is used to turn on the boxplot by using logical TRUE. The default is FALSE.\n\n\n\n15.4.3 Parallel coordinates with facet\nSince ggparcoord() is developed by extending ggplot2 package, we can combination use some of the ggplot2 function when plotting a parallel coordinates plot.\nIn the code chunk below, facet_wrap() of ggplot2 is used to plot 10 small multiple parallel coordinates plots. Each plot represent one geographical region such as East Asia.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the aesthetic defect of the current design is that some of the variable names overlap on x-axis.\n15.4.4 Rotating x-axis text label\nTo make the x-axis text label easy to read, let us rotate the labels by 30 degrees. We can rotate axis text labels using theme() function in ggplot2 as shown in the code chunk below\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nTo rotate x-axis text labels, we use axis.text.x as argument to theme() function. And we specify element_text(angle = 30) to rotate the x-axis text by an angle 30 degree.\n\n\n\n15.4.5 Adjusting the rotated x-axis text label\nRotating x-axis text labels to 30 degrees makes the label overlap with the plot and we can avoid this by adjusting the text location using hjust argument to theme’s text element with element_text(). We use axis.text.x as we want to change the look of x-axis text.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 100, hjust=0.1))"

In this section, we will perform the following steps to manipulate and prepare a data.frtame that is appropriate for treemap visualisation:\n\ngroup transaction records by Project Name, Planning Region, Planning Area, Property Type and Type of Sale, and\ncompute Total Unit Sold, Total Area, Median Unit Price and Median Transacted Price by applying appropriate summary statistics on No. of Units, Area (sqm), Unit Price ($ psm) and Transacted Price ($) respectively.\n\nTwo key verbs of dplyr package, namely: group_by() and summarize() will be used to perform these steps.\ngroup_by() breaks down a data.frame into specified groups of rows. When you then apply the verbs above on the resulting object they’ll be automatically applied “by group”.\nGrouping affects the verbs as follows:\n\ngrouped select() is the same as ungrouped select(), except that grouping variables are always retained.\ngrouped arrange() is the same as ungrouped; unless you set .by_group = TRUE, in which case it orders first by the grouping variables.\nmutate() and filter() are most useful in conjunction with window functions (like rank(), or min(x) == x). They are described in detail in vignette(“window-functions”).\nsample_n() and sample_frac() sample the specified number/fraction of rows in each group.\nsummarise() computes the summary for each group.\n\nIn our case, group_by() will used together with summarise() to derive the summarised data.frame.\n\n\n16.3.3 Grouped summaries without the Pipe\nThe code chank below shows a typical two lines code approach to perform the steps.\n\nrealis2018_grouped &lt;- group_by(realis2018, `Project Name`,\n                               `Planning Region`, `Planning Area`, \n                               `Property Type`, `Type of Sale`)\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- summarise(realis2018_grouped, \n                          `Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE), \n                          `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Project Name', 'Planning Region',\n'Planning Area', 'Property Type'. You can override using the `.groups`\nargument.\n\n\nNotes:Aggregation functions such as sum() and meadian() obey the usual rule of missing values: if there’s any missing value in the input, the output will be a missing value. The argument na.rm = TRUE removes the missing values prior to computation.\nThe code chunk above is not very efficient because we have to give each intermediate data.frame a name, even though we don’t have to care about it.\n\n\n16.3.4 Grouped summaries with the pipe\nThe code chunk below shows a more efficient way to tackle the same processes by using the pipe, %&gt;%: (To learn more about pipe, visit this excellent article: Pipes in R Tutorial For Beginners.)\n\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- realis2018 %&gt;% \n  group_by(`Project Name`,`Planning Region`, \n           `Planning Area`, `Property Type`, \n           `Type of Sale`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE), \n            `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Project Name', 'Planning Region',\n'Planning Area', 'Property Type'.

    "section": "16.4 Designing Treemap with treemap Package",
    "text": "16.4 Designing Treemap with treemap Package\ntreemap package is a R package specially designed to offer great flexibility in drawing treemaps. The core function, namely: treemap() offers at least 43 arguments. In this section, we will only explore the major arguments for designing elegent and yet truthful treemaps.\n\n16.4.1 Designing a static treemap\nIn this section, treemap() of Treemap package is used to plot a treemap showing the distribution of median unit prices and total unit sold of resale condominium by geographic hierarchy in 2017.\nFirst, we will select records belongs to resale condominium property type from realis2018_selected data frame.\n\nrealis2018_selected &lt;- realis2018_summarised %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == \"Condominium\", `Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\n\n\n16.4.2 Using the basic arguments\nThe code chunk below designed a treemap by using three core arguments of treemap(), namely: index, vSize and vColor.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the three arguments used:\n\nindex\n\nThe index vector must consist of at least two column names or else no hierarchy treemap will be plotted.\nIf multiple column names are provided, such as the code chunk above, the first name is the highest aggregation level, the second name the second highest aggregation level, and so on.\n\nvSize\n\nThe column must not contain negative values. This is because it’s vaues will be used to map the sizes of the rectangles of the treemaps.\n\n\nWarning:\nThe treemap above was wrongly coloured. For a correctly designed treemap, the colours of the rectagles should be in different intensity showing, in our case, median unit prices.\nFor treemap(), vColor is used in combination with the argument type to determines the colours of the rectangles. Without defining type, like the code chunk above, treemap() assumes type = index, in our case, the hierarchy of planning areas.\n\n\n16.4.3 Working with vColor and type arguments\nIn the code chunk below, type argument is define as value.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type = \"value\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking to learn from the conde chunk above.\n\nThe rectangles are coloured with different intensity of green, reflecting their respective median unit prices.\nThe legend reveals that the values are binned into ten bins, i.e. 0-5000, 5000-10000, etc. with an equal interval of 5000.\n\n\n\n16.4.4 Colours in treemap package\nThere are two arguments that determine the mapping to color palettes: mapping and palette. The only difference between “value” and “manual” is the default value for mapping. The “value” treemap considers palette to be a diverging color palette (say ColorBrewer’s “RdYlBu”), and maps it in such a way that 0 corresponds to the middle color (typically white or yellow), -max(abs(values)) to the left-end color, and max(abs(values)), to the right-end color. The “manual” treemap simply maps min(values) to the left-end color, max(values) to the right-end color, and mean(range(values)) to the middle color.\n\n\n16.4.5 The “value” type treemap\nThe code chunk below shows a value type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"value\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nalthough the colour palette used is RdYlBu but there are no red rectangles in the treemap above. This is because all the median unit prices are positive.\nThe reason why we see only 5000 to 45000 in the legend is because the range argument is by default c(min(values, max(values)) with some pretty rounding.\n\n\n\n16.4.6 The “manual” type treemap\nThe “manual” type does not interpret the values as the “value” type does. Instead, the value range is mapped linearly to the colour palette.\nThe code chunk below shows a manual type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nThe colour scheme used is very copnfusing. This is because mapping = (min(values), mean(range(values)), max(values)). It is not wise to use diverging colour palette such as RdYlBu if the values are all positive or negative\n\nTo overcome this problem, a single colour palette such as Blues should be used\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4.7 Treemap Layout\ntreemap() supports two popular treemap layouts, namely: “squarified” and “pivotSize”. The default is “pivotSize”.\nThe squarified treemap algorithm (Bruls et al., 2000) produces good aspect ratios, but ignores the sorting order of the rectangles (sortID). The ordered treemap, pivot-by-size, algorithm (Bederson et al., 2002) takes the sorting order (sortID) into account while aspect ratios are still acceptable.\n\n\n16.4.8 Working with algorithm argument\nThe code chunk below plots a squarified treemap by changing the algorithm argument.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"squarified\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4.9 Using sortID\nWhen “pivotSize” algorithm is used, sortID argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n        sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )"

Could not check Bioconductor.\n\nPlease use `install.packages('BiocManager')` and then retry.\n\n\nWarning in p_install(package, character.only = TRUE, ...):\n\n\nWarning in library(package, lib.loc = lib.loc, character.only = TRUE,\nlogical.return = TRUE, : there is no package called 'CGPfunctions'\n\n\nWarning in pacman::p_load(scales, viridis, lubridate, ggthemes, gridExtra, : Failed to install/load:\nCGPfunctions\n\n\n##17.3 Plotting Calendar Heatmap In this section, we will learn how to plot a calender heatmap programmatically by using ggplot2 package. ##17.4 The data eventlog.csv file will be used. This data file consists of 199,999 rows of time-series cyber attack records by country. ###17.4.2 Importing Data First, you will use the code chunk below to import eventlog.csv file into R environment and called the data frame as attacks.\n\nattacks &lt;- read_csv(\"data/eventlog.csv\")\n\nRows: 199999 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (2): source_country, tz\ndttm (1): timestamp\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n##1#7.4.3 Examining the data structure It is always a good practice to examine the imported data frame before further analysis is performed. For example, kable() can be used to review the structure of the imported data frame.\n\nkable(head(attacks))\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\nsource_country\ntz\n\n\n\n\n2015-03-12 15:59:16\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:00:48\nFR\nEurope/Paris\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:02:26\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:02:38\nUS\nAmerica/Chicago\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:03:22\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:03:45\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations:\n\ntimestamp field stores date-time values in POSIXct format.\nsource_country field stores the source of the attack. It is in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.\ntz field stores time zone of the source IP address.\n\n\n17.4.4 Data Preparation\nStep 1: Deriving weekday and hour of day fields\nBefore we can plot the calender heatmap, two new fields namely wkday and hour need to be derived. In this step, we will write a function to perform the task."
